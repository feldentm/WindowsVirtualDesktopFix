Detailed description: TODO LINK
License: Free as in free markets.

## Controlls:
- `Ctrl + Alt + Arrows`: Move Desktop
- `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Arrows`: Move Current Window To Desktop
- `Ctrl + Alt + Num1-9`: Current Window Tiling
- `Ctrl + Shift + A`: Open Git Bash (requires git installation)

## Known Limitations:
Current window detection is sometimes broken, especially when moving over empty desktops. This is likely a bug in the desktop environment itself and unrelated to this script or AutoHotkey.
