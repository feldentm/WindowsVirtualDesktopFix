Fix virtual desktops on Windows with AHK 2.
Detailed description: TODO LINK

## Controlls
- `Ctrl + Alt + Arrows`: Move Desktop
- `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Arrows`: Move Current Window To Desktop
- `Ctrl + Alt + Num1-9`: Current Window Tiling
- `Ctrl + Shift + A`: Open Git Bash (requires git installation)

## Recommendations
- [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher) is a great addition.
- Make your systray visible in the task bar to see current desktop as icon.

## Known Limitations
Current window detection is sometimes broken, especially when moving over empty desktops. This is likely a bug in the desktop environment itself and unrelated to this script or AutoHotkey.

## License
Free as in free markets.
